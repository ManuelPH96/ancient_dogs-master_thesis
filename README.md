# ancient_dogs-master_thesis
This is a repository to present supplementary information belonging to my Master Thesis in Bioinformatics at the University of Murcia and The Centre for Agricultural Genomics in Barcelona.
Here you can consult the genotypes for the variants associated to body size and other phenotypic traits in the ancient dataset (Supplementary table 1 and 2). I refer to these tables several times in the Master Thesis manuscript.
Thanks for reading,
